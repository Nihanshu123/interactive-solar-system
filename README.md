# 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is a mobile-responsive, interactive 3D simulation of our solar system built using **Three.js**. It demonstrates orbital mechanics, lighting, and user interaction in a smooth browser-based experience.

## Features

- Realistic 3D Sun and all 8 planets orbiting around it
- Adjustable orbital speed for each planet in real-time
- Pause/Resume animation control
- Dark/Light mode toggle for the UI
- Tooltips that display planet names on hover
- Camera zoom and auto-focus on planet click
- Reset View button to return to default perspective
- Background stars for enhanced realism

## Project Structure

```
solar-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main HTML file with UI and layout,JavaScript logic using Three.js
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Instructions and documentation

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

This project is self-contained in a single HTML file and requires **no installation** or local server.

1.  **Download the Files:** Make sure you have the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).
    - You can typically do this by **double-clicking** the `index.html` file.
    - Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file into an open browser window.

The simulation will load and start running immediately.

#### Using VS Code Live Server:

1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
2. Open the project folder
3. Right-click `index.html` â†’ **"Open with Live Server"**
